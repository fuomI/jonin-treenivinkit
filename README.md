These are my first webpages that I made for a website course in Laurea UAS. 

The site was made using Bootsrap 4.5 framework.
The goal was to make visually appealing static site that also scaled well to different devices.

Site is also published on Netlify: https://serene-hamilton-61c7b1.netlify.app
